    "system_prompt = \"\"\"You are an English writing expert and you need to set hard essay prompts for the genre of Realistic Fiction. Your aim is to generate extremely hard constraints that make the essay writing very challenging. \n",
    "\n",
    "An essay prompt is defined as a main Instruction + Constraints. You will be given an Instruction as an input and you should generate more complex constraints that can be added to the Instruction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints can be defined in the following categories - \n",
    "Content - Egs: Climate change impacts, .\n",
    "Linguistic - Egs: Victorian English, Pirate slang.\n",
    "Style - Egs: Respectful Tone, ELI5\n",
    "Format - Egs: List 3 bullet points, paragraphs.\n",
    "Number - Egs: 500 word essay, three arguments for electric vehicles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definitions are just for your reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Give me a numbered list of EXACTLY {} CONSTRAINTS.\n",
    "\n",
    "The constraints should be complex and creative but as the genre is Realistic Fiction, be true to the genre. The constraints should be clear and atomic, that is, if a constraint can be decomposed into multiple sub constraints, list all of them separately. Although challenging, it should be possible to write a coherent story with a flow using your constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "IMPORTANT: Your constraints should be UNIQUE. DO NOT GIVE CONTRADICTORY CONSTRAINTS. It should NOT require any specific domain knowledge to understand the constraints. DO NOT INCLUDE COMPLICATED OR POETRY RELATED VOCABULARY in your responses. DO NOT START YOUR LINE WITH THE CONSTRAINT CATEGORY (Lisguistic:, Format:, etc), JUST GIVE ONLY THE CONSTRAINT.\n",
